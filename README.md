TDD_Test_Framework

This is TDD framework with Page Object model design pattern using Selenium, Java, Maven, TestNG, Appium in the IntelliJ IDE.
I have used Shopkick native app and created automated test for landing page. As I have created this framework for native app, I have used appium.

This framework is light weight and help to reduce the code duplication. All properties, locators, methods are clearly define which can be changed easily in future. This framework could be enhanced for web application as well for native apps.
