TDD_Test_Framework

I created small TDD framework with Page Object model design pattern using Selenium, Java, Maven, TestNG, Appium in the IntelliJ IDE. I have used Shop kick native app and created automated test for landing page. As I have created this framework for native app, I have used Appium.

This contains all the pages as separate java file, so that associated methods can be accessed with ease. It contains base class and all page object classes extends Base class. POM file will contain all needed dependencies.

This framework is light weight and help to reduce the code duplication. All properties, locators, methods are clearly defined which can be changed easily in future. This framework could be enhanced for web application as well for native apps.
